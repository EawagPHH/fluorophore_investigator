<p>This tool is designed to help identify possible "bleed-over" between channels when mulitplexing a digitial PCR (dPCR) assay.</p>
<p>The graph shows the wavelength range covered by a particular filter. This can be altered using the drop-down menu in the sidebar by selecting the machine you are using and spectrum type you are investigating.</p>
<p>Currently the filters used in the Prism3 and Prism6 imaging machines from Stilla are pre-defined.</p> 
<p>If you are using a different machine select <i>Custom</i>, indicate how many filters your machine has and then input the minimum and maximum wavelengths. Make sure to indicate the number of filters first as changing this value re-sets the wavelength inputs.</p>
<p>Fluorophore spectra can be displayed by checking the box beside the name of the fluorophore in the list.</p>
