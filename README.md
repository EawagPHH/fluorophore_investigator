This tool is designed to help identify possible "bleed-over" between channels when mulitplexing a digitial PCR (dPCR) assay.

The graph shows the wavelength range covered by a particular filter. This can be altered using the drop-down menu in the sidebar by selecting the machine you are using and spectrum type you are investigating.

Currently the filters used in the Prism3 and Prism6 imaging machines from Stilla are pre-defined.

If you are using a different machine select _Custom_, indicate how many filters your machine has and then input the minimum and maximum wavelengths. Make sure to indicate the number of filters first as changing this value re-sets the wavelength inputs.

Fluorophore spectra can be displayed by checking the box beside the name of the fluorophore in the list.
